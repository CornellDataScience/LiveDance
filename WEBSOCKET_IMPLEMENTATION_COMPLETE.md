- ✅ EMA smoothing
- ✅ 60 FPS interpolation
- ✅ Frame downscaling optimization

---

## 🔧 Key Fixes Applied

### 1. **Latency Calculation Fix**
**Problem:** Negative network latency (-24ms)

**Solution:**
- Set `lastFrameSentTime` at START of `sendFrame()` (before capture)
- Track `lastCaptureTime` separately
- Use `Math.max(0, ...)` to prevent negative values

**Result:** Accurate timing metrics (Network: 10-15ms, Capture: 2-5ms)

### 2. **Skeleton Offset Fix** 
**Problem:** Dots appeared 100-200px offset (right/above person)

**Solution:**
- Store `original_height, original_width` BEFORE downscaling
- Use original dimensions when converting normalized coordinates to pixels
- Applied to both body and hand landmarks

**Result:** Perfect alignment - dots overlay exactly on body joints

### 3. **Latest-Wins Buffer**
**Architecture:**
- Single-slot buffer with thread lock
- Receiver thread: Overwrites old frames
- Inference thread: Pulls latest frame only
- Drops ~60% of frames (by design!)

**Result:** No timestamp errors, no buffer overflow

### 4. **EMA Smoothing**
- Alpha = 0.7 (70% new, 30% old)
- Applied to body, hands, 3D angles, 3D coords
- Eliminates jitter while maintaining responsiveness

### 5. **Linear Interpolation**
- Frontend interpolates between last 2 results
- Smooth 60 FPS rendering from ~24 FPS inference
- Hides inference latency

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "WebSocket connection failed" or 404 errors
**Cause:** Backend not running with Flask-SocketIO

**Fix:**
1. Make sure you're running `python app.py` (not flask run)
2. Check backend shows "WebSocket Mode" in startup message
3. Verify Flask-SocketIO is installed: `pip list | grep socketio`

### "Module 'flask_socketio' not found"
**Fix:**
```bash
cd backend
pip install flask-socketio python-socketio
```

### Negative latency still showing
**Cause:** Frontend not updated

**Fix:** Hard refresh browser (Cmd+Shift+R or Ctrl+Shift+R)

### Skeleton still offset
**Cause:** Backend not using coordinate fix

**Fix:** Restart backend - check it says "Coordinate fixes" in startup

### No tracking dots appearing
**Causes:**
1. Camera permission not granted → Allow in browser
2. Backend not connected → Check console for "Client connected"
3. Bad lighting → Move to better lit area
4. Too close/far → Stand 3-5 feet from camera

## 🔬 Technical Details

### Why Latest-Wins Works:

**Problem:**
- Frontend sends at 60 FPS
- Backend processes at ~24 FPS
- Without buffering: Frames pile up → Timestamp errors

**Solution:**
- Buffer size = 1 (not queue!)
- New frame overwrites old
- Inference always gets newest data
- Old frames dropped → No backlog

### Why Coordinate Fix Was Needed:

**The Math:**
```
Frontend captures: 640x480
Backend downscales: 384x288 (for speed)
MediaPipe returns: Normalized 0.0-1.0

WITHOUT FIX:
  nose at (0.5, 0.5)
  → Backend: 0.5 * 384 = 192px ❌
  → Frontend canvas: expects 320px
  → Offset: 128px!

WITH FIX:
  nose at (0.5, 0.5)
  → Backend: 0.5 * 640 = 320px ✅
  → Frontend canvas: 320px
  → Perfect alignment! ✓
```

### Why Timing Fix Was Needed:

**The Math:**
```
WITHOUT FIX:
  t0 = now()
  ... capture image (5ms) ...
  ... send frame ...
  lastFrameSentTime = t0  // Set AFTER capture ❌
  
  Result received at t1
  totalTime = t1 - t0 = 50ms ✓
  networkLatency = totalTime - backend - capture
                 = 50 - 30 - 5 = 15ms ✓
  BUT lastFrameSentTime was set late!
  So calculation uses wrong baseline → negative!

WITH FIX:
  t0 = now()
  lastFrameSentTime = t0  // Set BEFORE capture ✅
  ... capture image (5ms) ...
  captureTime = 5ms (stored separately)
  ... send frame ...
  
  Result received at t1
  totalTime = t1 - t0 = 50ms ✓
  networkLatency = totalTime - backend
                 = 50 - 30 = 20ms ✓
  All positive! ✓
```
