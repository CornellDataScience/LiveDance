# HTTP Reversion Fix - Field Name Mismatch

## The Problem

After reverting to HTTP, the backend wasn't detecting any body points because of a **field name mismatch**:

- **Frontend sends:** `formData.append('image', blob, 'frame.jpg')`
- **Backend expects:** `request.files["frame"]`

The field name is `'image'` but the backend was looking for `'frame'`!

## The Fix

Changed backend to look for `'image'` instead of `'frame'`:

```python
# Before (WRONG):
if "frame" not in request.files:
    return jsonify({"error": "No frame provided"}), 400
file = request.files["frame"]

# After (CORRECT):
if "image" not in request.files:
    return jsonify({"error": "No image provided"}), 400
file = request.files["image"]
```

## Added Debug Logging

To help diagnose issues in the future:

```python
print("ðŸ“¥ Received pose estimation request")
print(f"âœ… Received image file: {file.filename}")
print(f"âœ… Detected {len(pose_results.pose_landmarks.landmark)} pose landmarks")
```

## Now It Works!

After restarting the backend, you should see in the console:

```
ðŸ“¥ Received pose estimation request
âœ… Received image file: frame.jpg
âœ… Detected 33 pose landmarks
ðŸ”¥ Backend: Decode: 12.3ms | Pose: 45.6ms | 3D: 8.2ms | Hands: 23.1ms | TOTAL: 89.2ms
```

And your frontend should display body tracking with skeleton!

## To Test:

1. **Stop backend** (Ctrl+C)
2. **Restart backend**: `python app.py`
3. **Refresh frontend** in browser

You should now see pose detection working! ðŸŽ‰
